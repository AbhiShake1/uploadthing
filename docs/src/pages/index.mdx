import { Callout, Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

# Getting Started

> These docs assume you're using Next.js - docs for other frameworks coming
> soon!

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the packages

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react react-dropzone 
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    yarn add uploadthing @uploadthing/react react-dropzone 
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    pnpm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react react-dropzone 
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Add env variables

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
UPLOADTHING_URL=https://yourapp.com # The URL to your app
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you're deploying through Vercel, you can omit the `UPLOADTHING_URL`
  variable and we'll use the URL provided by Vercel by default. In development,
  we'll use `http://localhost:3000` by default unless you specify otherwise.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign up](/create-account) and create one from
  the [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>
</Steps>
